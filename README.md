# Process::Metrics

Extract performance and memory metrics from running processes.

## Installation

To add it to your current project:

	bundle add process-metrics

## Usage

Memory is measured in kilobytes and time is measured in seconds.

### Command Line

You can use the `process-metrics` command line to print data about a running process and it's children:

![Command Line Example](command-line.png)

### Capturing for Specific Process

You can capture the metrics for a single process:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'process/metrics'

metrics = Process::Metrics.capture(pid: Process.pid)

pp metrics
# [{:pid=>282195,
#   :ppid=>230572,
#   :pgid=>282195,
#   :pcpu=>0.0,
#   :time=>0,
#   :vsz=>78800,
#   :rss=>14360,
#   :etime=>0,
#   :command=>"ruby /tmp/6b35f421-4595-45d6-b444-754a50636daf",
#   :memory=>
#    {:total=>78804,
#     :rss=>14600,
#     :pss=>9208,
#     :shared_clean=>5728,
#     :shared_dirty=>0,
#     :private_clean=>16,
#     :private_dirty=>8856,
#     :referenced=>14600,
#     :anonymous=>8856,
#     :swap=>0,
#     :swap_pss=>0,
#     :maps=>150}}]
```

### Capturing for Process Hierarchy

You can capture the metrics for a process and all it's children:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'process/metrics'

ppid = ENV["PPID"].to_i
metrics = Process::Metrics.capture(pid: ppid, ppid: ppid)

pp metrics
# [{:pid=>68536,
#   :ppid=>46295,
#   :pgid=>68536,
#   :pcpu=>0.0,
#   :time=>0,
#   :vsz=>94516,
#   :rss=>29688,
#   :etime=>41057,
#   :command=>

### Metrics

On some platforms (currently only Linux), additional memory metrics are captured.

#### Proportional Set Size

The total private memory usage + shared memory usage divided by the number of processes sharing said data.

#### Unique Set Size

The total private memory usage.
