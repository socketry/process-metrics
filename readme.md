## Usage

Please see the [project documentation](https://socketry.github.io/process-metrics/) for more details.

  - [Getting Started](https://socketry.github.io/process-metrics/guides/getting-started/index) - This guide explains how to use the `process-metrics` gem to collect and analyze process metrics including processor and memory utilization.

## Releases

Please see the [project releases](https://socketry.github.io/process-metrics/releases/index) for all releases.

### v0.5.1

  - Fixed Linux memory usage capture to correctly read memory statistics.

### v0.5.0

  - Added `--total-memory` option for scaling memory usage graphs, allowing users to set custom total memory values.
  - Improved support for proportional memory usage (PSS).
  - Exposed total system memory information.

### v0.4.0

  - Fixed command formatting in output display.
  - Modernized codebase to use current Ruby conventions.
  - Improved Darwin (macOS) support with better platform-specific handling.

### v0.3.0

  - Added support for `smaps_rollup` on Linux for more efficient memory statistics collection.
  - Fixed `smaps_rollup` detection (corrected file path).
  - Removed `sz` metric (not supported on Darwin).
  - Expanded test coverage.
  - Improved documentation with better syntax highlighting and fixed links.
  - Avoided abbreviations in naming conventions for better code clarity.
  - Added missing dependencies: `bake-test-external` and `json` gem.
  - Added summary lines for PSS (Proportional Set Size) and USS (Unique Set Size).

### v0.2.1

  - Added missing dependency to gemspec.
  - Added example of command line usage to documentation.
  - Renamed `rsz` to `rss` (Resident Set Size) for consistency across Darwin and Linux platforms.

### v0.2.0

  - Added `process-metrics` command line interface for monitoring processes.
  - Implemented structured data using Ruby structs for better performance and clarity.
  - Added documentation about PSS (Proportional Set Size) and USS (Unique Set Size) metrics.

### v0.1.1

  - Removed `Gemfile.lock` from version control.
  - Fixed process metrics to exclude the `ps` command itself from measurements.
  - Fixed documentation formatting issues.

### v0.1.0

  - Initial release with support for process and memory metrics on Linux and Darwin (macOS).
  - Support for selecting processes based on PID or PPID (process group).
  - Implementation of memory statistics collection using `/proc` filesystem on Linux.
  - Better handling of process hierarchies.
  - Support for older Ruby versions.
